Write a simple program with two functions in object orientation.
Expectation: Be sure to use object orientation!

Function 1:
- read the data in the files in the data folder (and any subfolders) (sample folder included)
- every file contains a JSON data structure, the ID is the name of the file
- based on the type, instantiate the appropriate transport type (only the two types you see are possible)
- put the received object into a list
- on the go, log on the screen that the program is running and working (no need for an hourglass or anything like that, just a simple signal)

Function 2:
- write the elements in the list returned by the first function to the screen in a nicely formatted way
